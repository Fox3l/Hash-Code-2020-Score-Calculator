Executable files do not require any .dll to work, but they need .hashcode files as mentioned below.

You have to put the .exe file in the same folder as your file (mono-file version) or your whole submission (multi-file version).
If you want to use the multi-file version, just pur all your submission files in the same folder and rename them as Google's input file.

You also need to put "data" folder in the same folder as the executable (you can find it in the root of this repository)
